I"M<p>This post goes over how to build a basic Alexa Skill.</p>

<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Have an AWS account (we will only be using services under the free tier so donâ€™t worry about this costing you any ðŸ’°).</li>
  <li>Have created an account at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">developer.amazon.com</code> (under the same account your Alexa device is associated with).</li>
  <li><strong>Note</strong> - An Alexa device is not required for this tutorial but it is fun to test your deployed skill and see it in action!</li>
</ul>
