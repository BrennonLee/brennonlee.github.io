I"®<p>This post goes over how to build a basic Alexa Skill. The tutorial takes you through the process of creating a lambda function, deploying an Alexa skill, and being able to ask Alexa to pick a Star Wars film for you.</p>

<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Have an AWS account (we will only be using services under the free tier so don‚Äôt worry about this costing you any üí∞).</li>
  <li>Have created an account at <a href="https://www.developer.amazon.com">developer.amazon.com</a> (under the same account your Alexa device is associated with).</li>
  <li><strong>Note</strong> - An Alexa device is not required for this tutorial but it is fun to test your deployed skill and see it in action!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="create-a-lambda-function">Create A Lambda Function</h2>
<p>To get started, we need to create a new lambda function that will act as the endpoint for our Alexa skill to hit when invoked.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Head over to the lambda service on the AWS Console and hit ‚ÄúCreate Function‚Äù.</li>
  <li>To make it easy, there are publicly available libraries to help us get spun up within minutes. Select the ‚ÄúBrowse serverless app repository‚Äù option and click ‚Äúalexa-skills-kit-nodejs-factskill‚Äù:

  <li>We are going to keep all the defaults for this project so scroll to the bottom and deploy the lambda function!
<img src="/images/2020-08-08/deploy-lambda.png" alt="_config.yml" /></li>
  <li>After a few moments your lambda function should be successfully deployed! You will see it on your lambda dashboard. Go ahead and click on your new function to view the details. Scroll down to the function code and find the object <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enData</code>. You should change the array of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FACTS</code> to look something like this:
<img src="/images/2020-08-08/star-wars-code.png" alt="_config.yml" />
Make sure to hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Save</code> after making your changes!</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Scroll down to enData and change the facts array to your star wars movie names</li>
</ul>
