I"¨<p>This post is to help configure CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) on AWS S3 for Static Sites.</p>

<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Have an AWS account (we will only be using services under the free tier so donâ€™t worry about this costing you any ğŸ’°).</li>
  <li>You are logged into the AWS Console.</li>
</ul>

<p>First, we need to create a bucket that will host our static site. Head over to the Amazon S3 and create a bucket like so:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-07-10/create-bucket.png" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>For simplicity of this tutorial, go ahead and uncheck â€œBlock all public accessâ€. You should see a banner popup that makes you confirm this action. This is going to make this bucket publicly accessible (this is needed so we can make the files weâ€™ll upload later on available).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-07-10/ack-public-access.png" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>Once your bucket is created, we want our bucket to host our static website.
To set that up, navigate over to â€œPropertiesâ€ -&gt; â€œStatic website hostingâ€ -&gt; and check â€œUse this bucket to host a websiteâ€. A few fields will popup asking which HTML files to use and weâ€™ll just stick with the defaults.</p>
