I"Ù<p>This post goes over how to build a basic Alexa Skill. The tutorial takes you through the process of creating a lambda function, deploying an Alexa skill, and being able to ask Alexa to pick a Star Wars film for you.</p>

<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Note</strong> - An Alexa device is not required for this tutorial but it is fun to test your deployed skill and see it in action!</li>
  <li>Have an AWS account (we will only be using services under the free tier so donâ€™t worry about this costing you any ğŸ’°).</li>
  <li>Have an account at <a href="https://www.developer.amazon.com">developer.amazon.com</a> (under the same account your Alexa device is associated with).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="create-a-lambda-function">Create a Lambda Function</h2>
<p>To get started, we need to create a new lambda function that will act as the endpoint for our Alexa skill to hit when invoked.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Head over to the lambda service on the AWS Console and hit â€œCreate Functionâ€.</li>
  <li>To make it easy, there are publicly available libraries to help us get spun up within minutes. Select the â€œBrowse serverless app repositoryâ€ option and click â€œalexa-skills-kit-nodejs-factskillâ€:
<img src="/images/2020-08-08/create-lambda.png" alt="_config.yml" /></li>
  <li>We are going to keep all the defaults for this project so scroll to the bottom and deploy the lambda function!
<img src="/images/2020-08-08/deploy-lambda.png" alt="_config.yml" /></li>
  <li>After a few moments your lambda function should be successfully deployed! You will see it on your lambda dashboard. Go ahead and click on your new function to view the details. Scroll down to the function code and find the object <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enData</code>. You should change the array of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FACTS</code> to look something like this:
<img src="/images/2020-08-08/star-wars-code.png" alt="_config.yml" />
Make sure to hit â€œSaveâ€ after making your changes!</li>
  <li>Lastly, take note of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARN</code> endpoint at the top right of your screen. This is important when we build our Alexa skill in the next section.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="deploy-your-alexa-skill">Deploy your Alexa Skill</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In a new tab, navigate to your account on <a href="https://www.developer.amazon.com">developer.amazon.com</a>. From there,
hit â€œDeveloper Consoleâ€ â€“&gt; â€œAlexa Skills Kitâ€. And letâ€™s create a new skill:
<img src="/images/2020-08-08/create-skill.png" alt="_config.yml" /></li>
  <li>Next, give your skill any suitable name (this will not effect the invocation cue). I went with â€œStarWarsMoviePickerâ€ for mine. Weâ€™re also going to go with the â€œCustomâ€ model for our skill.
<img src="/images/2020-08-08/skill-details.png" alt="_config.yml" /></li>
  <li>For our template, we already are using the public repository for the Fact Skill in our lambda function so weâ€™re going to use that as our skill template.
<img src="/images/2020-08-08/template.png" alt="_config.yml" />
Go ahead and continue from this step and create your skill! After a few minutes you will land on your new skillâ€™s dashboard.</li>
  <li>We need to set the invocation name for the new skill (this is what begins the interaction with Alexa on a particular skill). Navigate to the section titled â€œInvocationâ€ and enter in â€œstar wars cloudâ€ as your skill invocation name and press â€œSave Modelâ€.</li>
  <li>Before building the model, we need to set the endpoint to our lambda function so it references our Star Wars data when invoked. Under â€œEndpointâ€, next to â€œDefault Regionâ€, paste in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARN</code> you copied from the last step of the lambda setup above.</li>
  <li>Save your changes and hit â€œBuild Modelâ€. This should take a few minutes but once built, youâ€™ll receive a popup notification in the bottom right of your screen.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="test-your-alexa-skill">Test your Alexa Skill</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Now youâ€™re ready to test your deployed Alexa skill! Navigate to the â€œtestâ€ tab under your Alexa skill and change the testing enabled environment to â€œDevelopmentâ€. You should then be able to click on the input box and trigger your Alexa skill like so:
<img src="/images/2020-08-08/testing-skill.png" alt="_config.yml" /></li>
</ol>

<p>Because we configured our skillâ€™s endpoint with our lambdaâ€™s ARN. Your response will pull from the array of movies we setup in that function. If you have your own Alexa device that was registered under the same account, you should now be able to use the same trigger in the simulator on your physical device!</p>

<h3 id="congratulations-">Congratulations! ğŸ‰</h3>
<p>You just built your very own Alexa skill that connects to a custom lambda function to pick a random Star Wars film. Iâ€™d say itâ€™s time to celebrate by asking Alexa which film you should sit down and enjoy (preferably between episodes 1-6)!</p>
