<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Have an AWS account (we will only be using services under the free tier so don’t worry about this costing you any 💰).</li>
  <li>You are logged into the AWS Console.</li>
</ul>

<p>First, we need to create a bucket that will host our static site. Head over to the Amazon S3 service and create a bucket like so:</p>

<p>For simplicity of this tutorial, go ahead and uncheck “Block all public access”. You should see a banner popup that makes you confirm this action. This is going to make this bucket publicly accessible (this is needed so we can make the files we’ll upload available to the public later on).</p>
